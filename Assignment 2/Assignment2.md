 ## Group A: Short Questions ( 2 marks)

1.Define the term "sitemap" in the planning process


In the planning process, a **sitemap** is a simple outline or diagram that shows all the pages of a website and how they are connected to each other. It helps plan the structure of the website so information is easy to find and organize.



2.What is the purpose of the "Launch" phase in the web developnment


The purpose of the **Launch** phase in web development is to make the website live and available to users. During this phase, final checks are done, errors are fixed, the site is tested, and then it is published on the internet so people can access it.


3.Why is "Documentation" important in the developnment lifecycle?


**Documentation** is important in the development lifecycle because it explains how the system works and how it was built. It helps developers understand, use, fix, and update the project in the future, and makes it easier for new team members to work on it.


4.Differentiate between frontend and backend developnment


**Frontend development** deals with the part of a website or app that users see and interact with, such as the layout, colors, buttons, and text. It focuses on design and user experience.

**Backend development** works behind the scenes. It handles the server, database, and application logic, such as storing data, processing requests, and making sure everything works correctly.



## Group B: Long Questions ( 4 marks)
5."Planning is the most critical phase of web developnment". Discuss this statement by listing the key actitivites performed during the planning phase


Planning is considered the most critical phase of web development because it lays the foundation for the entire project. Good planning helps avoid mistakes, saves time and cost, and ensures the website meets its goals. The key activities performed during the planning phase include:

1. **Defining Goals and Objectives**
   This involves identifying the purpose of the website, such as informing users, selling products, or providing services.

2. **Identifying Target Audience**
   Understanding who will use the website helps in designing content and features that suit their needs.

3. **Requirement Analysis**
   Listing all features, functions, and technical needs of the website to ensure nothing important is missed.

4. **Creating a Sitemap**
   Organizing the website structure by outlining all pages and how they connect, making navigation clear and user-friendly.

5. **Content Planning**
   Deciding what text, images, videos, and other content will be included on each page.

6. **Technology Selection**
   Choosing the tools, programming languages, frameworks, and platforms needed to build the website.

7. **Project Timeline and Budget Planning**
   Estimating the time required, setting deadlines, and planning costs to keep the project on track.

Because all later phases depend on these decisions, effective planning ensures smoother development and a successful website.



6.Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly ”finished”?



The **Maintenance phase** is **iterative** because it involves repeated and ongoing activities rather than a one-time task. After a website is launched, it must be continuously checked, updated, and improved based on user needs and changes in technology.

During maintenance, developers regularly:

* Fix bugs and errors that appear after real users start using the site
* Update content to keep information current and relevant
* Improve features based on user feedback
* Enhance security to protect against new threats
* Optimize performance as traffic grows

A website is **never truly “finished”** because user expectations change, technology evolves, and businesses update their goals. New devices, browsers, and security risks also require constant updates. Therefore, maintenance is an ongoing cycle of monitoring, updating, and improving the website to keep it effective and useful.


7.Describe the process of ”Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?


**Information Gathering** is the process of collecting all the necessary details before building a website. This includes understanding the website’s purpose, what features it needs, what content will be included, and how it should work.

Understanding the **target audience** is crucial during this step because the website is being made for them. Knowing their age, needs, preferences, and skills helps developers design the site in a way that is easy to use, attractive, and useful. When the audience is well understood, the website is more likely to be successful.




## Group C: Scenario-Based questions


8.You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the ”Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase.

Skipping the **Testing** phase may seem like a way to save money and launch faster, but it can create serious problems that may cost much more later.

First, **security risks** increase without testing. An e-commerce site handles sensitive customer information like personal details and payment data. Without proper security testing, the site may have weaknesses that hackers can exploit, leading to data breaches, loss of customer trust, and possible legal issues.

Second, **functionality problems** are likely. Features such as product search, shopping carts, payments, and order confirmations may not work correctly. If customers face errors while shopping or paying, they may abandon the site, resulting in lost sales and a damaged reputation.

Third, **compatibility issues** can occur. Without testing, the website may not work properly on different devices, browsers, or screen sizes. Customers using mobile phones or certain browsers could have a poor experience or be unable to use the site at all.

In the long run, skipping testing often leads to higher costs due to emergency fixes, customer complaints, and lost revenue. Proper testing helps ensure the website is secure, reliable, and user-friendly, making it a smart investment rather than an unnecessary expense.




9.A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled.


In this scenario, the project failed due to skipping essential early phases of the web development process. Coding began immediately after the client meeting, without proper planning or design validation. This led to misalignment between the developer’s assumptions and the client’s expectations




10.A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase.


The phase that was neglected is the Maintenance phase of the web development lifecycle. Although the university website was launched successfully, failing to update exam schedules caused the content to become outdated, leading to a loss of student trust and engagement.
